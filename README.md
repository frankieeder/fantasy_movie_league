INTRODUCTION
------------

An object-oriented version of the knapsack problem, fantasy_movie_league parses third-party box-office projections and computes the highest-earning Fantasy Movie League bracket for a given week.

Fantasy Movie League rules can be found here: https://fantasymovieleague.com/howtoplay


REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * Python 3.


QUICK START
-----------

In Terminal, run either all_weeks.py (which runs all sidecar files), or one of the sidecar files (of the format week_<quarter>_<year>_<week>.py) to compute the best bracket for the specific week to which that sidecar file corresponds.

To add a new week, run new_week.py and input the necessary strings. This will also add the new week you make to all_weeks.py
